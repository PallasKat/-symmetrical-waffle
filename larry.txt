Larry is the 10 Downing Street cat and is Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. 
Larry is a brown and white tabby, believed to have been born c. January 2007.

After taking up his appointment, Larry quickly developed a reputation for being 
late to attend meetings and aggression towards news reporters. By July 2016, 
when Theresa May became Prime Minister, Larry had developed a reputation of 
being "violent" in his interactions with other local mousers, namely the Foreign 
Office's much younger cat Palmerston.
